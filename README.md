# 📖 Project Overview

This project analyzes the usage of AI tools among students in a school, exploring patterns across grades, fields of study, and devices. The goal is to uncover insights about AI adoption and its perceived usefulness among students.



# 🗂️ Project Structure

schema.sql
Defines the database schema: tables for student info, AI tool usage, and ratings.

data_cleaning.sql
Standardizes and cleans the data, e.g., formatting grades and normalizing Yes/No responses.

analysis.sql
Contains queries to:

Count students per grade using AI

Analyze AI usage by field of study

Investigate devices used for AI activities

Identify the most popular AI tools per grade

Calculate average usefulness ratings per tool



# 🔑 Key Insights

8th-grade students show the highest AI tool adoption.

Mathematics students use AI tools most actively, while Humanities students use them less.

Mobile devices are the dominant platform for AI usage.

ChatGPT and Notion AI are perceived as the most useful tools; Phind scores lower in usefulness.

Data helps reveal patterns in AI adoption and informs which tools are effective for different student groups.
